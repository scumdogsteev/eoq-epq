### Instructions

1. Click the "EOQ" or "EPQ" tab.
2. Enter the parameters (demand, costs, etc.) in the side bar.
3. Click the "Calculate Optimal Order Quantity" (EOQ tab) or "Calculate Optimal 
   Production Quantity" button to see how the EOQ or EPQ, as well as their
   associated costs and order intervals, change.
